I'm a Mechatronics engineer (M.Tech, KL University) passionate about building real-world robotics and automation systems. I work across the stack: control systems and MATLAB/Simulink, embedded C on microcontrollers, CAN/SPI/UART protocols, ROS and Python for autonomy and ML, and practical tooling from CAD to QGIS/SNAP for geospatial projects.

Focus areas:

- Swarm robotics and distributed algorithms
- Robotic manipulation with embedded motor control
- Crop field boundary detection and classification using ML + satellite data
- Autonomous systems research and motion/control

I enjoy tackling challenging, end-to-end problems and collaborating in teams. I'm currently open to roles in Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Embedded/Controls.
